**[A lightweight shell script](https://starrytony.github.io/Build-Latex-Projects/)** supports compiling latex source files of any complicated project to a pdf document. Has been tested on MacOS and can work with Linux in theory (might need slight changes). Because I do coding with different languages and need a consistent editing & building environment without any distraction, I use this script with my text editor to write latex documents. Both generating pdf and comparing to historical can choose either live mode or not.

**[Why]**  
* Use any preferred text editor;  
* Easily manage complicated latex projects;  
* Without losing any advanced features for building a latex project;  
* Use tools provided by the MacTex installation package and do not want to install any extra tool except MacTex;  
* Do not distract your writing;  
* Fast.

**[Features]**  
* Maintain a global configuration and a local configuration for each project;  
* Remember historical operations;  
* Maintain version history;  
* Easily load a latex project;  
* Auto search version history & the entry .tex;  
* Rename a latex project;  
* Choose latex engine & bibliography backend;  
* Choose encoding for \*.tex;  
* Count words directly from the output pdf document;  
* Support live preview;  
* Support comparing to historical versions in live mode (live mode is not completed yet);  
* Clean dump files and compress for commit;  
* Highlighted error & warn tips;  
* Foldable menu;  
* Customisable theme;  
* Quickly install missing packages using the tlmgr tool provided by the MacTex;  
* Can easily expand with new functions / configurations.
